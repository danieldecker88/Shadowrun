Haroldo's SGCC libraries v1.0 quick readme:

GENESIS.C -> Slightly improved version of Paul W. Lee's GENESIS.C

GENESISB.C -> Suplementary Sega Genesis routines, by me.

GENESIS.H -> Header file for both GENESIS.C and GENESISB.C

GFS.C -> Sega Genesis File System routines. The Genesis File System (GFS) is
         a set of routines intended to simplify the inclusion of binary data
         into a ROM file. All one needs to do is to use MAKEGFS.EXE (included
         with my SGCC utilities) to take all the binary data that one wants
         to be included on the ROM, and then all of them will be reunited in
         a single file. Then, compile your source without the data, and
         finally use APPLYGFS.EXE to merge the code with the GFS file. See
         TEST.C for an example.

GFS.H -> Header file for the above.

INTERR.C -> Interrupt routines. You will notice that both units are empty.
            In order to actually use them, you have to add your own code.
            init_interr is called by the runtime library during the
            initialization, and poll_interr is called at each VBL (about
            60Hz).

INTERR.H -> Header file for the above.

MAKEFILE -> Makefile for TEST.C. First of all, you'll have to run MKDAT.BAT,
            under the DATA\ subdirectory, in order to create GAMEDATA.GFS,
            and then run the makefile using MAKE. Notice that the MAKE that
            comes with SGCC has a bug with subdirectories, and will not be
            able to run this makefile, so you'll have to use another MAKE.
            I have tested FPC's MAKE.EXE and Borland's MAKE.EXE, and both of
            them worked allright.

OBJET.INC -> List of all the objects that will have to be linked. Used by the
             makefile.

PLEE.S -> Long multiplication/long division support for SGCC, by Johann Ruegg

PSGSOUND.C -> PSG sound routines by Kevin Banks.

PSGSOUND.H -> Header for the above

RDC.C -> RDC decompression routines. To be used with data compressed by
         RDC.EXE, included with my utilities.

RDC.H -> Header for the above.

FONT.C -> 8x8 1bpp font loading routines.

FONT.H -> Header for the above.

RPGWALK.C -> Routines for making a walking character, adequated for an RPG.

RPGWALK.H -> Header for the above

SEGA.S -> The runtime library.

CONIO.C -> Vastly improved version of Kaneda's port of CONIO.C. Still
           incomplete, though.

CONIO.H -> Header for the above.

STRING.C -> Kaneda's port of standard C string library.

STRING.H -> Header for the above.

TEST.C -> A little example to show how to use the libraries. Not very clean
          code, though.

UTILS.C -> Some useful routines, most important of them being random().

UTILS.H -> Header for the above.
